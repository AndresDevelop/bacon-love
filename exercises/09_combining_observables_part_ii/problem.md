# Combining Observables, part II

## The Problem

Thanks to the intel you have provided throughout the defence campain against
the Zrrk invasion, the Earthian Defence Force has concluded that the Zrrk come
in peace. The EDF have decided that in order to show signs of good will
towards the apparently friendly Zrrk to broadcast the withdrawal status of the
EDF fleet.

The solar system is divided into five sectors, with EDF ships being deployed
in sector one through four. Your final assignment will be to provide a report
for the Zrrk commander on the current status of deployed EDF ships in all five
sectors of the solar system.
