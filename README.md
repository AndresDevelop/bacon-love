bacon-love â€“ the Workshop for Functional Reactive Programming
====

This is a Nodeschool-esc workshop module for doing Functional Reactive
Programming (FRP) using the library [Bacon.js](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js).

The goal of this workshop is to learn the concept of FRP while solving
exercises, and the implementation it self is not that important. Most
of the methods used in this workshop might as well be used in an alternative
like [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS). The main difference
is that Bacon adhere to classic theory of FRP (with a distinction between
observables).

### Tip

If you find that there is too much text and want it scrollable (with `less`),
you can pipe the print of the current exercise by doing the following:
